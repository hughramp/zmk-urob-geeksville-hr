# Geeksville notes

Alas, devcontainers don't work well with nix.  So instead just follow the original instructions after making
an Ubuntu based distrobox instance.  MAKE SURE TO ENABLE SYSTEMD in the selection gui.

## TODO

* Possibly add . to the nummode layer?  To allow typing 345.23 easily.
* !enable zmk studio layers
* turn on serial console emulation
* !Make game layer
* Someday use https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1qc5729/zmk_local_build_script_build_your_firmware_locally/ to build?

## Game layer

This layer replaces the left 3x6 and the three thumb keys beneath it with a gaming layout.
Note: This is only a summary.  See config/game_layer.h for the actual layout (the right half is essentially qwerty).

```
tab  1/6    2/7 3/8 4/9 5/0
esc  q      a   w   d   r
ctrl z      x   s   e   c

     alt space shift

Note: if shift is held then the 5 number keys (1-5) become 6 through 0.

```

## Build instructions
Then add direnv to the shared ~/.bashrc (though I already did this)
> echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

Then run the following commands in the "nix-devshell" distrobox:

```
bash # make sure we are using bash (and pull in the rc)
direnv allow # to pull in all required nix cruft
just init # setup build
just build all
```

Note: the ble status advertisements spit out warnings due to:

This **might** be okay?  because the ptr is in a union where the argument is used correctly.  We'll see
if it runs...

It also prints some warnings about misconfigured CONFIG entries when building the right half (because
some of those flags only are set on the left).  Might be okay also...
